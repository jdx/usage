# Usage

Usage is a spec and CLI for defining CLI tools. Arguments, flags, environment variables, and config files
can all be defined in a Usage spec. It can be thought of like [OpenAPI (swagger)](https://www.openapis.org/)
for CLIs. Here are some potential reasons for defining your CLI with a Usage spec:

* Generate autocompletion scripts
* Generate markdown documentation
* Generate man pages
* Use an advanced arg parser in any language
* Scaffold one spec into different CLI frameworksâ€”even different languages
* [coming soon] Host your CLI documentation on usage.sh

> [!CAUTION]
> This is a work in progress. The usage-cli code is not intended to be used by other people yet. Hopefully that will change soon and people can start testing it.
> Have a look at the docs and let me know what you think.
