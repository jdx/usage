Write user-friendly release notes in markdown:

1. First line: `# ` followed by a pithy, descriptive title (not just the version). For smaller or less impactful releases, keep the title understated and modest. Examples:
   - "# PowerShell Support & Bug Fixes"
   - "# Performance Improvements"
   - "# New Completion Features"

TONE CALIBRATION:
- Match the tone and length to the actual significance of the changes
- If the release is mostly small bug fixes or minor tweaks, be upfront about that—a sentence or two of summary is fine, don't write multiple paragraphs inflating the importance
- Reserve enthusiastic, detailed write-ups for releases with genuinely significant features or changes
- It's okay to say "This is a smaller release focused on bug fixes" when that's the case

2. Then a summary proportional to the significance of the changes
3. Organize into ## sections (Highlights, Bug Fixes, etc.) as needed
4. Explain WHY changes matter to users
5. Include PR links and documentation links (https://usage.jdx.dev/)
6. Include contributor usernames (@username). Do not thank @jdx since that is who is writing these notes.
7. Skip internal/trivial changes

Output markdown only, starting with the # title line.
