## Mounting dynamic commands

A usage spec can define a command to run which emits extra usage spec which will be merged into the
cmd.
For example, assume a CLI named `mycli` has a command `run` which executes a set of tasks, those
tasks
are themselves commands which have their own sets of args/flags dynamically generated. To support
this,
create a hidden command like `mycli mount-usage-tasks` which emits usage spec for the tasks. Then,
create a `mount` on the `run` command. Here is the static usage spec for the `mycli` CLI as
described:

```sh
cmd "mount-usage-tasks" hide=#true
cmd "run" {
	mount run="mycli mount-usage-tasks"
}
```

Calling `mycli mount-usage-tasks` would emit something like this:

```sh
cmd "task1" {
  arg "arg1" help="task1 arg1"
  flag "flag1" help="task1 flag1"
}
cmd "task2" {
  arg "arg1" help="task2 arg1"
  flag "flag1" help="task2 flag1"
}
```

Now when using completion with usage, if the user types `mycli run <tab><tab>`, usage will then
call `mycli mount-usage-tasks` and merge the emitted usage into the `run` command and display the
task commands as if they were statically defined in the usage spec.
